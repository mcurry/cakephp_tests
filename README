/* Description */
A short template for doing CakePHP model unit test.  The differences from the baked test files:
  - The fixture uses "var import" to get the schema from the original table.
  - The model test doesn't need a mock model.  It uses ClassRegistry::init to load the original model, but sets it to use the test db.
